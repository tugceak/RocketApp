## RocketApp
ROCKETAPP is an Android Application that fetch data from /api.spacexdata.com/v4/
and list data in recyclerview.And it uses to Room keep favorite Rockets and Launches.

The main goal of this app is to be a sample of how to build an high quality Android application that uses the Architecture components, Retrofit2 etc. in Kotlin.


## Architecture
ROCKETAPP uses MVVM [Model-View-ViewModel] architecture to have a unidirectional flow of data, separation of concern, testability, and a lot more and Ä±t uses to HILT
to provide a standard way to incorporate Dagger dependency injection into an Android application.


## What IS MVVM?
Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) is a software design pattern that is structured to separate program logic and user interface controls. MVVM is also known as model-view-binder and was created by Microsoft architects Ken Cooper and John Gossman.
## What Is HILT?
Hilt is a dependency injection library for Android that reduces the boilerplate of doing manual dependency injection in your project.
Hilt provides a standard way to use DI in your application by providing containers for every Android class in your project and managing their lifecycles automatically. Hilt is built on top of the popular DI library Dagger to benefit from the compile-time correctness, runtime performance, scalability, and Android Studio support that Dagger provides
## What Is ROOM?
Room is a Database Object Mapping library that makes it easy to access database on Android applications.
